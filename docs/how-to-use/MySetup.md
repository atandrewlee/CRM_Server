# My Requirements For Building My CRM
1. Well integrated & low barrier-to-entry to use.
    - An issue I've found while building systems for processes (ex. personal-finance, productivity, routines, etc.) is reducing the "friction" to use it and be effective.
    - *Example*: While working, put your phone "out-of-sight" (e.g: other end of room). The "friction" to check your phone has slightly increased, the likelihood of actually checking is significantly decreased.
    - *Problem*: Many processes have too much friction to use consistently. Therefore, its effectiveness is greatly decreased.
    - *Goal*: To reduce friction -> easy to interact with & actually use
2. Data/Tech Control (Privacy & Security): I've been looking to better secure and privatize my tech life. Therefore, I hope to be able to self-host & control my data.
    - Data: If all my tools dissapear tomorrow, the data is still safe, controlled by me, and in formats that are standardized (SQL Tables, Text (Markdown) Files)
    - Tools: If possible, use Open-Source or tools with good development & support.
3. Only necessary features: . The features implemented are purpose-built and simple for me to be effective.




## Daily Notes
#todo: I'll add a link detailing my productivity system in more detail to better highlight the integration of the CRM (and what makes it work simply).

## Database + Frontend
- Database: PostgreSQL server on a [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) instance.
  - (07/11/24) It is on a Vultr cloud instance. I'm considering moving it to my local HomeLab when I get a more proper networking setup.
- Database UI: [NocoDB](https://www.nocodb.com/)
  - TLDR >> Open-Source, Self-Hosted Notion/Airtable alternative that can be run on your own database (SQLite, Postgres)
  - This allows me the flexibility, control, & freedom of hosting my own PostgreSQL database with the convienence of a nice UI with extra features.
